  This script will enumerate all user accounts in a Domain, calculate their estimated Token Size and create
  a report of the top x users in CSV format.

  Script Name: Get-TokenSizeReport.ps1
  Release 1.8
  Modified by Jeremy@jhouseconsulting.com 31/12/2013
  Written by Jeremy@jhouseconsulting.com 02/12/2013

  Original script was derived from the CheckMaxTokenSize.ps1 written by Tim Springston [MS] on 7/19/2013
  http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Check-for-MaxTokenSize-520e51e5

  Re-wrote the script to be more efficient and provide a report for all users in the
  Domain.

  Although it's not documented in KB327825 or any other Microsoft references, I also add the number of
  global groups outside the user's account domain that the user is a member of to the "d" calculation of
  the TokenSize. Whilst the Microsoft methodology is to add universal groups from other domains, it is
  possible to add global groups too. Therefore it's important to capture this and correctly include it in
  the calculation.

  For users with large tokens consider reducing direct and transitive (nested) group memberships.
  Larger environments that have evolved over time also have a tendancy to suffer from Circular Group
  Nesting and sIDHistory.

  On the odd ocasion I was receiving the following error:
  - Exception calling "FindByIdentity" with "2" argument(s): "Multiple principals contain
    a matching Identity."
  - There seemed to be a known bug in .NET 4.x when passing two arguments to the FindByIdentity() method.
  - The solution was to either use a machine with .NET 3.5 or re-write the script to pass
    three arguments as per the Get-UserPrincipal function provided in the following Scripting Guy article:
    - http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2009/10/08/hey-scripting-guy-october-8-2009.aspx
    This function passes the Context Type, FQDN Domain Name and Parent OU/Container.

  I have also seen the following error:
  - Exception calling "GetAuthorizationGroups" with "0" argument(s): "An error (1301) occurred while
    enumerating the groups. The group's SID could not be resolved."

  Added the tokenGroups attribute to get all nested groups as I could not achieve 100% reliability using
  the GetAuthorizationGroups() method. Could not afford for it to start failing after running for hours
  in large environments.

  There are important differences between using the GetAuthorizationGroups() method versus the tokenGroups
  attribute that need to be understood. Aside from the unreliability of GetAuthorizationGroups(), when push
  comes to shove you get different results depending on which method you use, and what you want to achieve.
    - The tokenGroups attribute only contains the actual "Active Directory" principals, which are groups and
      siDHistory.
    - However, tokenGroups does not reveal cross-forest/domain group memberships. The tokenGroups attribute
      is constructed by Active Directory on request, and this depends on the availability of a Global Catalog
      server: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms680275(VS.85).aspx
    - The GetAuthorizationGroups() method also returns the well-known security identifiers of the local
      system (LSALogonUser) for the user running the script, which will include groups such as:
      - Everyone (S-1-1-0)
      - Authenticated Users (S-1-5-11)
      - This Organization (S-1-5-15)
      - Low Mandatory Level (S-1-16-4096)
      This will vary depending on where you're running the script from and in what user context. The result
      is still consistent, as it adds the same overhead to each user. But this is misleading.
    - GetAuthorizationGroups() will return cross-forest/domain group memberships, but cannot resolve them
      because they contain a ForeignSecurityPrincipal. It therefore fails as documented above.
    - GetAuthorizationGroups() does not contain siDHistory.

  In my view you would use the tokenGroups attribute to collate a consistent and accurate user report across
  the environment, whereas the GetAuthorizationGroups() method could be used in a logon script to calucate
  the token of the user together with the system they are logging on to. The actual calculation of the token
  size adds the estimated value for ticket overhead anyway, hence the reason why using the tokenGroups
  attribute provides a consistent result for all users.
  If you wanted an accurate token size per user per system and GetAuthorizationGroups() method continues to
  prove to be unreliable, you could use the tokenGroups attribute together with the addition of the output
  from the "whoami /groups" command to get all the well-known groups and label needed to calculate the
  complete local token.

  Microsoft also has a tool called Tokensz.exe that could also be used in a logon script. It can be downloded
  from here: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=1448

  To be completed:
  - Some further research and testing needs to be completed with the code that retrieves the tokenGroups
    attribute to validate performance between the GetInfoEx method or RefreshCache method.
  - Work out how to report on cross-forest/domain group memberships as neither tokenGroups or
    GetAuthorizationGroups() can achieve this.
